# About
This repository is a visual studio solution containing a c-style library with functions for encrypting and decrypting bytes using AES-128 implemented from scratch, as well as four visual studio projects for testing and demonstrating its use. The project titled AES-128-Application is the most useful of the four, providing a user menu for input and operation selection, covering all functionality tested by the remaining text programs.
