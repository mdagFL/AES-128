# About
This repository is a visual studio solution containing a c-style C++ library with functions for encrypting and decrypting bytes using AES-128 implemented from scratch, as well as four visual studio projects for testing and demonstrating its use. The project titled AES-128-Application is comprehensive, providing a user menu for input and operation selection. It covers all functionality tested by the remaining test programs which were only used for initial testing of individual components of the library.
